#B Functionality

The sensorLibrary.c and .h files control allow for conversion of an analog input into a digital output
to beutilized in further programs.  The pins that are utilized for each of the sensors are as follows:

Left = 1.4 (Pin 6)  
Center = 1.5 (Pin 7)  
Right =  1.3 (Pin 5)  

The methods used to obtain the outputs for each censor are as follows:

Left = getLeft()  
Center = getCenter()  
Right =  getRight()
